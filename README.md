# piep

`piep` is a minimalist program to play an infinite sine wave tone. It works
only on Linux through the ALSA interface.

It was written with only one purpose: to keep my JBL Jembe speakers from
turning themselves off during quiet periods in a movie. Playing an inaudible 10
Hz tone in the background keeps them awake!

## Building

Just run `make`. There is no configurability.

## Running

Run `./piep`.
